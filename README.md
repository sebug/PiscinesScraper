Every month, the opening hours of the Geneva swimming pools are published
on their website *as a PDF*. Well, the following app extracts that information
by reading the table present in the PDF.

Ideally, I'd make a small iPhone app out of that to decide what to do
after work. For the moment it's just a proof-of-concept on how the
PDFDocument API works.

Output is logged, ignore the window :-)
